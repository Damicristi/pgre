# PGRE-Notes-by-Damodar
I have seen that there is no any materials written by a Nepali Student for Physics GRE test. So, I have taken an effort to share all the important guidelines that I learned during my learning period (08 Sept to Oct 26, 2018) for my own PGRE test. This means I have planned to write this test on Oct 27. To those who are reading my note, BEST OF LUCK!
