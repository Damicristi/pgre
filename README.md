# Notes for Physics GRE to Ace

Author voice: I have seen that there are no any materials written by a Nepali Student for Physics GRE test.
So, I have taken an effort to share all the important guidelines that I will learn during my learning period 
(08 Sept to Oct 26, 2018) for my own PGRE test. This means I have planned to write this test on Oct 27.
To those who are reading my note, BEST OF LUCK ON YOUR TEST!
