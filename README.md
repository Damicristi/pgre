My aim of creating this webpage is to make a full-fledged pGRE note in future by collaboration. Because I believe that sharing is caring and to have a better understanding of the topic. If you are interested in the project, I'm also definitely interested in your contribution. So that our work may be very useful who are needy of it. I consider contributor as Github user who edits my note LaTeX source code and then, does pull request. If you are new to Github then, you can learn how to create your first pull request from this free series ["How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub?"](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github){:target="_blank"}.
