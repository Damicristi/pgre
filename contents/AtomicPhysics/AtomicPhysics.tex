It includes properties of electrons, Bohr's model, energy quantization, atomic structure, atomic spectra, selection rules, black-body radiation, X-rays, atoms in electric fields, and atoms in magnetic fields.

If an external electron strikes and knocks the innermost electron then, another electron will jump into that place such occurs K (from some Bohr level $n \geq 2 \to n = 1$), L ($n \geq 2 \to n = 2$), M($n \geq 2 \to n = 3$), L ($n \geq 2 \to n = 4$) series transition. For the specific transition, the minimum transition \emph{energy} is given by \emph{Moseley's law},
\begin{align}
E = R_{e} (Z - \beta)^{2} \left( \frac{1}{n_{\text{final}}^{2}} - \frac{1}{n_{\text{initial}}^{2}} \right)
\end{align}
where, $R_{e}$ is the Rydberg energy which is equal to 13.6 eV.
