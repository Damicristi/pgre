It includes properties of electrons, Bohr's model, energy quantization, atomic structure, atomic spectra, selection rules, black-body radiation, X-rays, atoms in electric fields, and atoms in magnetic fields.

If an external electron strikes and knocks the innermost electron then, another electron will jump into that place such occurs K (from some Bohr level $n \geq 2 \to n = 1$), L ($n \geq 2 \to n = 2$), M($n \geq 2 \to n = 3$), L ($n \geq 2 \to n = 4$) series transition. For the specific transition, the minimum transition \emph{energy} is given by \emph{Moseley's law},
\begin{align}
E = R_{e} (Z - \beta)^{2} \left( \frac{1}{n_{\text{final}}^{2}} - \frac{1}{n_{\text{initial}}^{2}} \right)
\end{align}
where, $R_{e}$ is the Rydberg energy which is equal to 13.6 eV.

Atoms with a single electron in its outer shell can be thought of as analogous to a hydrogen atom and it has the electron charge distribution to be spherically symmetrical.

Radioactive elements have very low binding energy in-compared to others. The standard deviation for radioactive emission is described by the Poisson noise, $\sigma = \sqrt{\lambda}$ where $\lambda$ is the average number of radioactive samples. 

Compton scattering is the phenomena by which photons collide with a particle, impart some of their kinetic energy to the particle and then scatters off at a lower energy. The compton equation is,
\begin{align}
\lambda_{final} - \lambda_{initial} = \frac{h}{m c}(1 - cos(\theta))
\end{align}
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of photon, $m$ is its mass and $\theta$ is the scattering angle.

The Franck-Hertz experiment and related scattering experiments show us that at a specific energy range (4.9 volts to be specific in Franck-Hertz experiment) electrons begin to experience inelastic collisions and that energies lost in the collision came in discrete amounts.
