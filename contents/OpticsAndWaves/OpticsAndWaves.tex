It includes wave properties, superposition, interference, diffraction, geometrical optics, polarization, and Doppler effect.

Hologram is generated as the result of interference between two light beams and wave interference is dependent on wave phase.

The group velocity $v_{g}$ is related to the angular frequency $\omega$ is \begin{align}
v_{g} = \pdv{\omega}{k}
\end{align}
where $k$ is the magnitude of the propagation (or, wave) vector.

The Bragg's law of diffraction is $2d sin(\theta) = n\lambda $

The de-Broglie equation is $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$.
