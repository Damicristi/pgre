Kirchhoff's voltage loop law says the sum of all voltages about a complete circuit must sum to zero.

In a region where there are no charges inside but with a uniform potential on the surface then, the potential inside the center is exactly same that of surface.

The most ubiquitous Gauss's law is
\begin{align*}
\div\vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{0}} 
\end{align*}
 where $\rho$ is the total electric charge density (charge per unit volume).
 
The exponent in Coulomb's inverse square law has been found to differ from two by less than one part in a billion by measuring the electric field inside a charged conducting shell and the experiment was Faraday's Ice Pail.
