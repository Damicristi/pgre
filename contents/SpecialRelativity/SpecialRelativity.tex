\section{Special Relativity (6\%)}

It includes introductory concepts of relativity, simultaneity, energy and momentum, four-vectors, Lorentz transformation, velocity addition, time dilation, and length contraction.

The pseudo pythogorean theroem commonly called as spacetime interval is,
\begin{align}
\Delta s^{2} = -c\Delta t^{2} + \Delta r^{2}
\end{align}

If initially there is only an electric field, after the Lorentz transformation, there may be both an electric and a magnetic field. This is how an electromagnetic field behaves under a Lorentz transformation.
