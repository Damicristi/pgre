\section{Specialized topics (9\%)}

It includes Nuclear physics (e.g., nuclear properties, radioactive decay, fission reactions, and fusion reactions), Particle physics (e.g., fundamental properties of elementary particles), Condensed Matter physics (e.g., crystal structure, x-ray diffraction, thermal properties, electron theory of metals, semiconductors, and superconductors), and Miscellaneous (e.g., Astrophysics, Mathematical methods, and Computer applications).

The Hall effect is used in solid-state physics to measure the sign of the charge carriers.

One feature common to both Debye theory and the Einstein theory of the specific heat of a crystal composed of $N$ identical atoms is that the vibrational energy of the crystal is equivalent to the energy of $3N$ independent harmonic oscillators.


\subsection{Mathematical methods}

It includes single and multivariate calculus, co-ordinate systems (rectangular, cylindrical and spherical), vector algebra and vector differential operators, Fourier series, partial differential equations, boundary value problems, matrices and determinants, and function of complex variables.
