The mean free path equation for the probability of stopping a particle moving through medium is
\begin{align}
p(x) = n \sigma dx
\end{align}
where $P(x)$ is the probability of stopping the particle in the distance $dx$, n is the nuclei, $\sigma$ is the scattering cross section and $dx$ is the thickness of the scatterer.

According to Stefan's law (to be more specific, Stefan-Boltzmann's), power radiation of a blackbody is only dependent on temperature which is
\begin{align}
j = \sigma T^{4}
\end{align}
where $\sigma$ is a Stefan's constant.
